<p>The FAQ is in the general <a href="http://www.equiz.me/static/help.html">help/faq</a> for all users (not just instructors).

<h2>Typical Work Flow</h2>

<ul>

<li> Learn how to use the system.

<ul>

<li> Create an instructor account and two student test accounts.  (Google
ignores everything including and after a plus sign in the user name.
Thus, <u>myself+courseA@gmail.com</u> will send emails
to <u>myself@gmail.com</u>.  You can then search or create filters to select
only courseA related emails.</li>

<li> Create a few silly quizzes as instructor, fill them out as a
pretend-student. In the end, just delete the results.

</ul>

<li> Edit a testbank until you are satisfied.  Look at it via the "View
Testbank" on the right side of the file manager.</li>

<li> Rename the .testbank extension to a .quiz extension. </li>

<li> Tell your students about the quiz.  You can do that in class or by setting the
message for your students (in your account settings).</li>

<li> Look at the results.  "Run Grade Analytics" at the bottom of your file
manager to obtain grades-*.csv files, which you can download and
analyze.</li>

</ul> 

<h3><a name="#file_manager_files">Notes on Formatting of Questions</a></h3>

<p>Questions can include standard html.  Note that this means that an
instructor can destroy a quiz, too, e.g., by adding a &lt;/form&gt; tag into
a question.  Please don't.

<p>Math: You can use any html code you wish.  Thus, a &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; will produce a raised square (<sup>2</sup>).  Similarly, you can use other math symbols, such as &amp;int;, which should typeset into the integral sign, &amp;int;, provided your students' browsers understand it.  However, html is ultimately not particularly good at math.  (<a href="http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/math/">some examples and an explanation.)  The W3C working group wrote <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html3/maths.html">HTML Math</a> to consider how this should be done, but I don't think it went very far.  Fortunately, you can also include html &lt;img&gt; images that are created by latex, and they can be hosted anywhere.  Images are definitely a kludge, but they are also the only render-perfect kludges I know of, even though they are not resolution independent.



<h2><a name="#file_manager_files">Notes on the File Manager</a></h2>

<ul>

<li>Edit-ing files copies the original (previous) version into "-previous".</li>

<li>Delete-ing immediately removes all files that end in "-deleted" and
"-previous".  They cannot be recovered!  All other files are only renamed to
end in "-deleted".</li>

</ul>
