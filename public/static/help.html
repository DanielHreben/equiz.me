	<h2>FAQ</h2>

	<dl>
	  <dt>What are the legal conditions to use Equiz.Me?</dt>

	  <dd> See <a href="/static/legal.html" >Legals.</a> Primarily, they ask for 3 things: that you won't spoof your identity; that you won't intentionally break in; and that you are not primarily registering to reverse-engineer the system.  In addition, this page also contains a description of what the standard use license is for questions in the system, unless an instructor wants to make his questions more proprietary.  We want to make sharing questions easy.  There is no reason why hundreds of instructors need to write the same "Algebra 1" quiz.  However, for really proprietary material, instructors have the option to override the standard license, and/or not to share quizzes. </th> 



	  <dt>Who created Equiz.Me and why?</dt>

	 <dd>Primarily, <a href="http://www.ivo-welch.info">Ivo Welch</a>, a
	   professor at UCLA.  He needed an easy to use system for writing
	   quizzes where each student gets different numbers.  He couldn't
	   find one&mdash;at any price.  (There were more sophisticated
	   systems with steeper learning curves by expensive vendors.)
	   Because Ivo also needed this for his
	   free <a href="http://book.ivo-welch.info">corporate finance</a>
	   text book, and because the extra effort involved to make the quiz
	   system general was very little, he created Equiz.Me.</dd>



	  <dt>Who does the programming for Equiz.Me?</dt> <dd>Almost all of
	    it was done by <a target='_blank'
	    href='http://webbylab.com/en'>WebbyLab</a>.  They do primarily
	    perl-related work (which is how this system was written).  We
	    can recommend WebbyLab very highly.  Pleasure to work with.</dd>


	  <dt>What is the required precision in quiz answers?</dt>

 <dd> The normal rounding rule that determines whether a student's
numerical answer is considered correct is "smart precision," which is as follows:
	  <ul>
	    <li> if the (absolute) answer is greater than 10, it is enough
	      if the distance between the given and perfect correct answer
	      is less than 1.  For example, if the answer is -110, then
	      -109.5 is still acceptable.  -108.9 is not. </li>
	    <li> if the answer is between 1 and 10, it is enough if the
	      distance between the given and perfect correct answer is less
	      than 0.1.  For example, if the answer is -8, then -8.05 is
	      still acceptable.  -7.85 is not.</li>
	    <li> Otherwise, the distance between the given and perfect
	      correct answer must be less than 0.01.  For example, if the
	      answer is 0.12, 0.115 is acceptable. 0.10 is not.</li>
	   </ul>
	  It is indeterminate what happens if a student is exactly at the
	  border.  (This has to do with how computers handle binary
	  numbers.)  The above rule turns out to work <i>very</i> well in
	  almost all cases.

	<p>Nevertheless, instructors can also use the <tt>:P:</tt> tag to
	  require a different level of accuracy for student answers to
	  questions.

	<p> Note that it is important to impress upon students that they
	  should carry full accuracy in intermediate calculations.  (It
	     is easy to construct examples where intermediate rounding
	     creates havoc in the final answer.)



	  <dt>I calculated the formula correctly, but my final answer is different.  Why?</dt>

	  <dd>You must carry intermediate calculations with the full number
	    of digits.  If you do not, you may well get the wrong result.
	    For instance, in a perpetuity calculation, instead
	    of <code>$100/0.13567... ~ $737.08</code>, if you first round
	    the interest rate to <code>$100/0.136 ~ $735.29</code>, which is
	    too far off to be considered a correct result.  Watch out!</dd>


	  <dt>How do student quizzes look like?</dt>

	  <dd>Try a <a href="sample-quiz.html">sample quiz</a>.  Note that this is
	  not a real quiz, just a sample page markup.</dd>


	  <dt>How does the instructor system look like?  Is it really easy?</dt>

	  <dd>Yes, it is unbelievably easy for what it does&mdash;but to see
	  it, you will have to agree to some short and reasonable
	    <a href="legal.html">legalese</a> (primarily that you are going
	    to use your real name, that you are not going to try to break
	    in, and that you are not registering to reverse engineer the
	    system), and register as an instructor.  Usually, you then get
	    approved within 24 hours.  If it is not clear from your
	    credentials that you are an instructor, please send an email
	    to <a href="mailto:ivo.welch@anderson.ucla.edu">Ivo
	    Welch</a> explaining the circumstances.</dd>


	  <dt>Can an instructor use the system to teach a course on
	  something not Welch-book related?</dt>

	  <dd>Absolutely, yes.  In fact, the whole point of this system was
	    to make it easy to administer many different kinds of classes.
	    You can use the system to teach a course based on other finance
	    textbooks (including direct competitors), too.  There
	    are <i>no</i> restrictions here whatsoever.  (The only advantage
	    that this system provides for the Welch book is that the quizzes
	    for the Welch book are easily downloaded.</dd>

	  <dt>Do I have to be a university instructor to register as an instructor?</dt>

	  <dd>No.  You can be a school instructor or even a professional
	    instructor.  However, you must be an instructor.</dd>


	  <dt>Password/Authentication Trouble?</dt>

	  <dd>Make sure you look into your spam mailbox, too.  This is by
	    far the most common reason why emails have gone missing.  The
	    authentication email can be resent, too, by clicking on "Remind
	    Password", too.  Finally, the original registration email also
	    gives you a fallback password (URL), which contains a lot of
	    characters is unrememberable and which is unchangeable.  Store
	    this email in a safe place&mdash;print it and delete it from
	    your email.  Make sure your email mailbox is not compromised.</dd>

	  <dt>Registration Trouble?</dt>

	  <dd>Check your spam folder.  Again!  (Some German and other email services
	    block us.)  <b>Important:</b> Try setting up a free gmail or yahoo email
	    account to register.  You can later delete the account again.</dd>


	  <dt>Can a user (instructor or student) register for multiple accounts?</dt>

	  <dd>Yes.  The way to do this now is to use a "throw-away" email
	  address as a secondary.  For example <tt>first.last+a1@gmail.com</tt>,
	    <tt>first.last+a2@gmail.com</tt>, etc., all go
	    to <tt>first.last@gmail.com</tt>.  The only reason why we are
	    checking for duplicate emails is that we can sometimes remind
	    you that you already have an account.</dd>


	  <dt>Can an instructor administer different courses?</dt>

	<dd>Yes.  Just register under two different email addresses.  You
	can also use a throwaway email address for your second account.
	(Just remember that you may forget it more easily than your main
	email address.)   For example <tt>first.last+a1@gmail.com</tt>,
	    <tt>first.last+a2@gmail.com</tt>, etc., all go
	    to <tt>first.last@gmail.com</tt>.  The only reason why we are
	    checking for duplicate emails is that we can sometimes remind
	    you that you already have an account.</dd>



	  <dt>Can an instructor restrict the number of attempts to solve a quiz?</dt>

	  <dd>Yes and no.  The instructor receives data on <i>all</i>
	    attempts.  It is up to the instructor to base the grade on the
	    first, best, or last attempt.  However, I encourage allowing
	    repeated attempts.  Frankly, homeworks and quizzes are not good
	    grading devices.  Cheating on all dimensions is simply too easy.
	    A student could hire someone else to do the homework or look
	    over another student's questions (even though their own numbers
	    will be different).  They can also take similar tests, often
	    from another instructor using the same system.

	</dd>

	<dt>Can an instructor restrict who can answer questions?</dt>

	<dd>There is a password feature on each quiz. 

	<p>Coming Soon: classlist restrictions.  Instructors upload a list
	of students, and only these students can take the quiz.</p>

	</dd>




	  <dt>Can an instructor restrict a submission deadline?</dt>

	  <dd>Yes and no.  The instructor receives data on <i>all</i>
	    attempts, including the date of submission.  It is up to the
	    instructor to accept grades after a cutoff time.<br />
	    <span style="font-size:small">Instructors&mdash;if this is an important feature, please let me
	    know.  My own preference is to leave the quiz up.  You can always
	    decide later to accept hardship submissions, e.g., because a student's
	    notebook computer was stolen or the student was in the hospital.</span>
	  </dd>



	  <dt>Can student answers be timed?</dt>

	  <dd>The instructor receives information when a quiz was served and
	  when it was completed.</dd>



	  <dt>Will the score files be available until deleted by the professor?</dt>

	  <dd>This is indeed the plan.  However, a website can go down.  It
	    can be hacked.  Our advise is to download the grade file after
	    every quiz was due. (In version 3 or 4, we will allow this to
	    happen automatically&mdash;i.e., we will allow an instructor to
	    set a date when a quiz is due, and the results of that quiz will
	    be mailed at that time to the instructor's email address.)</dd>



	  <dt>When will accounts be deleted?</dt>

	  <dd>If your account contains nothing but the standard quizzes, we
	    may delete it at our discretion to reduce clutter.  If your
	    account shows evidence of some activity, e.g., your own quiz,
	    then it is our current plan to keep accounts for one year since
	    last activity.  If you want to maintain your account, just log
	    in at least once a year.</dd>



	  <dt>Why did some of my .testbank files (or my sample.quiz file)
	  just get deleted?</dt>

	  <dd>On occasion, we may update template files, such as the
	    sample.quiz file or the tutorial.testbank file.  When we do so,
	    we may delete user's replicas of these older template files,
	    even though they are located in their home directory.  We do not
	    delete files that were changed by the user. This way, the user
	    has a good hint that a better/newer version of the file exists,
	    and (s)he should just redownload it.  To avoid automatic
	    deletion, just change a character in your template file.</dd>


	  <dt>Can I delete my account myself?</dt>

	  <dd>In version X, we hope to have this as a feature.  Right now, even
	    the administrator does not have this function yet.</dd>


	  <dt>Can students access the submitted versions of the homework to
	  prepare for exams?</dt>

	  <dd>The quizzes themselves remain available as long as the instructor
	    keeps them posted.  They can also be repeated.  We are working on
	    making the student's own past answers available to the student.  It is
	    not yet there, but will be soon.</dd>
