<p>Equiz.Me is the easy solution for instructors who want to write
algorithmic quizzes and administer them online to their students.
(Algorithmic means that questions for every student are generated with
different numbers.  This is why equiz.me differs from existing survey and
quizzing tools, and why you should switch to it.)</p>

<p>The emphasis of the system is on simplicity:</p>
<ul>

<li>Learning how to administer previously designed quizzes and collecct
student answers should take about &lt; 10 minutes.</li>

<li>Learning how to write your own quizzes (or tailor existing quizzes)
should take another 5 minutes.  It's brillantly simple.</li>

<li>Students need no training</li>

</ul>

<p>You can read more at the <a href="help.html">Help/Faq</a> page now, or
look at a <a href="sample-quiz.html">sample quiz</a> the way a student will
see it.  Of course, the real advantages of Equiz.Me will not be apparent
unless you are an instructor---the ease of use and ease of creating quizzes.
There is no system that is easier and more intuitive than Equiz.Me.</p>

<p>Equiz.me was designed and is run
by <a href="http://www.ivo-welch.info">Ivo Welch</a>, a professor at UCLA
and author of a freely
accessible <a href="http://book.ivo-welch.info">Corporate Finance</a>
textbook.  However, equiz.me is suitable for any textbook or subject.</p>

<p>Registering as a student is open.  You can clear yourself by agreeing to some minimal legalese.</p>

<p>Registering as an instructor requires clearance&mdash;you may have to
email Ivo Welch some evidence of your instructor credentials if it is not
obvious from your registration, and it may take one day before your account
is approved.</p>
