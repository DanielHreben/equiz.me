<h2>Basic Use License</h2>

<p>To use Equiz.Me, you must agree to some very simple conditions:

<ul>

<li> You agree to provide correct credentials.</li> 

<li> You agree not to let others use your own account. </li>

<li> You agree that use of Equiz.Me is at your own risk.  Equiz.Me is
not liable for any damage it may create, such as loss or disclosure of
data, introduction of malware, downtime, third-party breakin, etc.</li>

<li> You agree not to deliberately attempt to break into the system,
but to use it for its designed purposes only. If you do notice a
security problem, you agree to inform us.</li>

<li> You understand that we may have to share your data under special
circumstances.  For example, you understand that instructors have full
access to the data of students (and potentially anyone else who take their
quizzes). Similarly, courts and law enforcement agencies and courts can
compel access to underlying data.</li>

<li> You agree not to upload information that should not be on this
website, such as copyrighted material, links to inappropriate
materials, etc.

<li> You agree to receive and not mark as spam occasional emails sent
to you from Equiz.Me (such as password recovery emails, or emails that
you are late in handing in an assignment[s]). </li>

<li> Instructors only: Unless the instructor marks their testbanks otherwise
in the testbank preamble, such testbanks are assumed to be under the SLEQL,
See also below.</li>

<li> You agree not to use the website with the primary intent and purpose of
designing a directly competing website.</li>

</ul>

<p>If you cannot agree to these conditions, you are not authorized to use
Equiz.Me.  If your situation changes and you can no longer agree to these
conditions, you agree to notify Equiz.Me (confirmation necessary) and to
abstain from any further use of Equiz.Me.

<hr />

<p>From our own Equiz.Me side, we will try to avoid any misbehavior.
However, there is no website that can guarantee this perfectly.  For
example, we may suffer a site breach.  We do not plan to share your data
with third parties (other than the instructor and administrative Equiz.Me
personnel) or to email spam.  Our site's reputation depends upon us behaving
properly.  We will strive hard to do so.  We will try to follow the golden
rule and treat you just like we would like to be treated ourselves.
However, there are no guarantees in life, and there are no guarantees for
your use of Equiz.Me.

<h2>Instructor Permissions and Standard Liberal Equiz.Me Question License (SEQL)</h2>

<p>The intent of the SLEQL is to facilitate building and enhancing
testbanks, quizzes, and questions (TQQ) collaboratively among many
instructors.  The intent is to give credit (acknowledgement) where it is
due; while preserving reasonable non-disclosure to students (in order to
keep the questions useful).</p>


<p>Equiz.Me instructor users must agree to the following:</p>

<ul>

<li>Equiz.Me does not claim intellectual ownership of TQQ.  The intellectual
ownership of TQQ belongs to the creators and their assignees, and not to
Equiz.Me.</li>

<li>Instructors agree not to create or upload TQQ if they are not legally
permitted to do so.</li>

<li>Instructors that use other instructors' TQQ agree to respect all
intellectual property rights.  In particular, this means following the
license terms of the TQQ.</li>

<li>Instructors agree to make violations of licenses known to the
intellectual owner of the TQQ being violated.</li>

<li>All TQQ in the Equiz.Me system that are not marked otherwise by the
creating instructor are automatically designated as being under the SLEQL.
This default application of the SLEQL as the default license is expressly
authorized by all instructor users of Equiz.Me and grants (non-exclusive)
use to all other registered Equiz.Me instructor users.</li>

<li>Instructors can designate any other license terms in
the <tt>::LICENSE::</tt> preamble (i.e., instead of the SLEQL).  Equiz.Me
will display such other license terms to other instructors reading,
searching, or browsing TQQs.  Instructors agree not to hold Equiz.Me liable
for violations of license terms by other instructors.
</li>

<li>To prevent read access of TQQs by other instructors requires the word
"PRIVATE" (capitalized) in the <tt>::LICENSE::</tt> section of the
preamble.</li>

<li>Instructors grant permission for the Equiz.Me system to make their TQQ
searchable by other instructors.  However, Equiz.Me will skip TQQ marked
PRIVATE in the <tt>::LICENSE::</tt> section of the preamble.</li>

<li>Again, TQQ under the SLEQL are permitted by their owners to be
searchable (discoverable) by and displayable to other Equiz.Me
instructors.</li>

<li>The SLEQL:
<ul>
<li> The author grants permission to any other
instructor in the Equiz.Me system to reuse and modify the question in
perpetuity and free of charge, provided the resulting TQQ is also licensed
under the <i>SLEQL</i> to facilitate further free collaboration.</li>

<li>Subsequent withdrawal of the SLEQL does not retrospectively change the
rights of instructors who had hitherto adopted questions that were under the
SLEQL.  In particular, previously derived questions continue to be under the
SLEQL.</li>

<li>The author requests to be credited in the <tt>:C:</tt> <i>source</i>
field of any reused or revised questions, visible <i>to instructors</i>.
The author does not request to be credited in the rendered question
display <i>to students</i>.</li>

<li>To maintain the usefulness of questions, instructors are not free to
redistribute the source of questions obtained under the SLEQL to students.</li>

<li>The SLEQL is not exclusive---creators can license their TQQ elsewhere
under other terms.</li>

</ul>
</ul>
